# Productivity Coins Extension

## Overview  
The Productivity Coins Extension is a tool designed to help you stay focused and manage your time effectively. By gamifying productivity, it encourages you to stay on track with your tasks and goals.  

## Features  
- **Productivity Coins System**: Earn or lose productivity coins based on your web activity.  
- **Website Blocking**: If your productivity coins reach zero, distracting websites like YouTube are automatically blocked.  
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Sync with your Google Calendar to track your schedule and prioritize tasks.  
- **Google Tasks Integration**: Stay on top of your to-do list by integrating with Google Tasks.  

## How It Works  
1. **Earn Coins**: Gain coins by completing tasks or staying focused on productive activities.  
2. **Lose Coins**: Coins are deducted for visiting distracting websites or engaging in unproductive activities.  
3. **Website Blocking**: When your coin balance hits zero, access to distracting websites is restricted until you earn more coins.  
4. **Task and Calendar Sync**: The extension uses your Google Calendar and Tasks to determine what you need to accomplish and guide your focus.
